Hive Optimization Technique

Mapper side join queries are taking too long.... 
use ORC file predicate pushdown...use vectorization...use partition based joins like use where to filter the data as much as possible..

It can be broadly classified into below categories
1. Table Design And File Format
--Partitioning
--Bucketing
--ORC File format or Parquet File Format

2. Optimization of query
-- Join Optimization
--- Map Side Join
--- Bucket Map Join
--- Sort Merge Join
-- Use of windows function to do complicated queries

3. Engine used for running hive
Tez or Spark enable Hive Engine

4. Use of appropiate compression format like snappy,LZO

5. Use of vectorization
Limitation :- This can be used only with ORC file format.

properties to set
set hive.vectorized.execution = true
set hive.vectorized.execution.enabled = true
6. Cost Based optimization
properties to set

set hive.cbo.enable=true;
set hive.compute.query.using.stats=true;
set hive.stats.fetch.column.stats=true;
set hive.stats.fetch.partition.stats=true
